# MSTU 5003 Design Document (Template)

I would like to create a website that can learn English online, which is aimed at students who wish to study in the United States, rather than zero-based children. So I would like to add the simulation test questions of the main test subjects of US University. such as the TOEFL test, GRE test, as well as GMAT test simulation questions. Students can practice online. At the same time, we provide online courses, students can pay classes, to accept the world's best English teacher's teachings. Home to be able to accept the authority of high level training teacher guidance. And in addition to the live course, you can also watch the course video; We also provides one-on-one online interactive teaching. All teachers receive online booking courses, more targeted for those who want to individual help students.
 In final, I plan to improve some of the content. Add the relevant test question simulation, online questions, and join the community culture, allowing registered users to share online learning experience. And ask the excellent students to share their experience.
 In addition, I will add the relevant extended reading link, so that through my platform with other existing resources for a good communication. I try to creat interactive pop-up window, so that when someone opens my page, that there will be a relevant customer service staff on-site consulting services. Try to motivate all students register. After the user registration, we will get the large data about how these user use our website. Concerned about the user interested in the topic, and then regularly push the relevant content, to provide users with the most valuable subscription service. At the same time, I plan to continue to optimize the content services, refine the content, so that the target audience will be more clearly. And the customers will easy and clear to understand all of the courses we offer. And clearly in the page to find the desired content. My teaching page, that is, a platform to share the exchange, but also a quick break test scores training base. My goal is to get high scores. The customer is very clear that who want to participate in these subjects examination, and hope to study in the United States students. Through a large number of online contact simulation questions, training the testing feeling. At the same time there are special exams Q & A. This is our teaching model. You can choose one-on-one, or one-to-many. So that we can refine the price of different products.

Midterm my teaching content is relatively missing. In Final I hope to add more, and with the most effective and not the most exaggerated way to keep my customers. Quickly raise scores, that is my profit approach.

Learning a language first is a long and complicated process, need to remember a lot of new words, familiar with the syntax of various sentences, and continue to practice. In listening, speaking, reading and writing a all need targeted practice, need the supervision of teachers, need a good learning language environment to do a lot of practice. So, I think learning English website also can used by the other subjects of learning, and even a variety of vocational skills training.

## Problem
I hope my website can solve the major difficulties of majority foreign students meet in learning new language.
1. students can’t persevere in learning, can’t remember the new words;
2. blind practice, slow to enhance the test score;
3. Lack of language environment, can’t interact practice after learning;
4.After obtaining excellent language scores, how to apply for school.


## Target Audience
Our website mainly aimed the high school and college students who want to study in United States. Students who have a certain language base but without language environment to practice and lack of understanding of the form of the language tests. Students who hope to get the most authoritative and training.
